"""Fuse orthogonal rotations into the weights.

Everything here happens offline and changes no computation the runtime performs: the
rotated model is mathematically identical to the original, which is exactly what
tests/test_rotation_invariance.py asserts. The point is that after rotation the *weights*
are far closer to Gaussian, so ternary rounding destroys much less.

Why every rotation FORGE uses is fusable
----------------------------------------
QuaRot and SpinQuant need online Hadamard transforms at inference time, which would force
a runtime graph change. Those online rotations exist mainly to tame *activation* outliers.
FORGE v1 is weight-only -- activations stay in the runtime's native precision -- so the
rotation's only job is to Gaussianize the weights, and the two rotations that do that are
both fusable:

  R1  a global rotation of the residual stream (hidden_size)
  R3  a per-head rotation between v_proj and o_proj (head_dim)

The two non-fusable ones (an online Hadamard before down_proj, and a post-RoPE q/k
rotation) are deliberately out of scope for v1.

R1: rotating the residual basis
-------------------------------
For orthogonal R, ||R.T x|| == ||x||, so a *plain* RMSNorm commutes with it. Qwen/Llama
RMSNorm carries a learned gain g, which does not, so the gain is folded into its consumers
first (W <- W @ diag(g)) and the norm is set to all-ones. Then with x~ = R.T x:

    token_embd (writer)   E  <- E @ R          rows are token vectors
    q,k,v,gate,up (reader) W <- W @ R
    o_proj, down_proj (writer) W <- R.T @ W
    lm_head (reader)      W  <- W @ R

Biases are untouched: an input rotation does not affect them, and the two writers are
bias-free in both architectures (asserted in tests/test_graph.py).

R3: the per-head value rotation
-------------------------------
Attention output is linear in V, so a head_dim x head_dim Hadamard applied to v_proj's
output cancels exactly when the inverse is applied to o_proj's input:

    W_v <- blockdiag(H, n_kv_heads) @ W_v       (and the same for v_proj's bias)
    W_o <- W_o @ blockdiag(H, n_heads).T

Under GQA the KV heads are repeated to n_heads before o_proj, so the two block-diagonals
have *different* repeat counts. Getting that wrong is the single most likely bug in this
file, which is why test_rotation_invariance covers GQA explicitly.
