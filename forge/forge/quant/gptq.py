"""Hessian-guided layer-wise reconstruction, ternary codebook.

Objective, per linear layer:

    argmin_Q ||(W - Q) X||_F^2  =  argmin_Q tr( (W-Q) H (W-Q)^T ),   H = 2/N sum x x^T

Solved with the GPTQ recursion: quantize one input column at a time, and push the rounding
error onto the columns not yet quantized, weighted by the inverse Hessian. A column that
the calibration data says matters gets compensated for by its correlated neighbours.

    q_j       = clamp(round(w_j / s_g), -1, 1) * s_g
    e_j       = (w_j - q_j) / Hinv[j, j]
    W[:, j:] -= e_j (x) Hinv[j, j:]

Two FORGE-specific details:

* The block scale s_g is refit at the start of every 256-column group, on the *already
  error-compensated* weights rather than on the original tensor. TQ2_0 stores one fp16
  scale per 256 weights, so this costs nothing and is what makes that per-block scale
  earn its keep.
* Act-order (processing columns by descending diag(H)) is deliberately omitted. It would
  scramble which weights share a block scale, and the permutation cannot be folded away
  for q/k/v/gate/up because their input is the shared residual stream with many consumers.
  The Hadamard rotation already flattens diag(H), so there is little left to gain --
  measurable via `forge.quant.gptq.hessian_flatness`.
